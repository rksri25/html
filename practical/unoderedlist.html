    <h1> 5 programming Quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute </li>
        <li> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?</li>
        <li>It's not at all important to get it right the first time. It's vitally important to get it right the last time.</li>
        <li>Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.</li>
        <li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</li>
    </ul>
